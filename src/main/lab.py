def demonstrate_variable_scope():

    """
    This function demonstrates variable scope in Python.
    
    Scope:
    Scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within a program. In Python, variables can have different scopes, 
    which determine where they can be accessed and modified. Understanding variable scope is crucial for writing maintainable and 
    bug-free code.
    
    Local Scope:
    Local scope refers to the scope of variables defined within a particular function or block of code. Variables defined within 
    a function have local scope, meaning they can only be accessed and modified within that function. These variables are not 
    visible to code outside the function and are destroyed once the function completes its execution.
    
    Global Scope:
    Global scope refers to the scope of variables defined outside of any function or block of code. Global variables are accessible 
    and modifiable from anywhere within the program, including within functions. However, when modifying global variables from 
    within a function, it's essential to use the 'global' keyword to explicitly declare that the variable is in the global scope.
    
    
    Instructions:
    1. Observe the error message generated when attempting to print local_var1 inside function1.
    2. Correct the error to successfully print local_var1 inside function1.
    3. Understand the concept of variable scope in Python and how it affects accessing variables inside nested functions.
