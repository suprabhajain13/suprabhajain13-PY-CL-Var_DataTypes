# PY-CL-Var_DataTypesPY-CL-Var_DataTypes

This project explores various Python data types and variable scope concepts. Below is a brief description of the files and their functionalities:

app.py

The app.py file serves as the main entry point of the project. It imports functions from the lab.py file to demonstrate different data types and variable scope. You can execute this file to see the demonstrations.

lab.py

The lab.py file contains functions that demonstrate different Python data types (integer, float, boolean, sequence, set, dictionary) and variable scope. Each function provides instructions and challenges to complete. Your task is to fill in the necessary code to meet the requirements outlined in the comments.

README.md

This README file provides an overview of the project, including descriptions of the main files and their purposes.

Project Structure:

- src/
  - main/
    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

To get started:

1. Open the src/main/app.py file.
2. Review the code and ensure that all necessary functions from lab.py are imported.
3. Run the app.py file to see the demonstrations of different data types and variable scope.

Remember:

- Modify the lab.py file to complete the challenges and demonstrations.
- Avoid making changes to the test files (lab_test.py).
- Run the test cases to verify the correctness of your implementations.

Happy coding!
